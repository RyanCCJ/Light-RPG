2. Follow the installation wizard's instructions to install the JDK.

3. After the installation is complete, you can verify the Java installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

   If the installation was successful, you'll see information about your Java version.

## Game Setup

- Each day consumes one unit of food.
- All characters have individual HP (Health Points), MP (Magic Points), and FP (Fatigue Points).
- Activities can reduce a character's HP, and when HP reaches zero, the character becomes unconscious.
- MP is used for various actions; characters need sufficient MP to perform actions.
- FP determines how many actions each character can take each day.
- At the start, all characters have 100 HP, 80 MP, 0 FP, and no food, coins, or drinks.

## Game Actions

In "Light-RPG," you can control your characters to perform the following actions:

- Move: Explore the map and advance to new locations.
- Rest: Rest the entire party for a day to recover HP and MP.
- Character-specific Actions: Each character has unique special actions, e.g., Robber's Robbery, Monk's Healing, and Bard's Music.
- Buy Food: Purchase food using coins to sustain your party.
- Adventure: Adventures may lead to finding treasures, battles, or other unexpected events.
- Build Huts: Spend coins to build huts, serving as your base of operations.

## Game Rules

- The game spans 10 days, and you must control the characters and perform actions every day.
- Days end when a character's FP reaches or exceeds 100 or when you choose to rest.
- Actions consume food, so choose your actions carefully to ensure your party's survival.
- Characters can earn coins, buy food, rob the rich, heal teammates, or play music to regain MP.
- After the game ends, your performance will be evaluated, and different titles will be awarded to your party.
